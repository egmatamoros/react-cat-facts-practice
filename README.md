## Description

This repository contains a React practice project that interacts with two different APIs to create a fun and dynamic application. The first API is used to fetch interesting cat facts, while the second API is used to generate cat images. The application then combines the fetched fact and the generated image to create a visual that presents the cat fact overlaid on the cat image
